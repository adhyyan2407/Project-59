        <p>Darwin Raglan Caspian Ahab Poseidon Nicodemius Watterson, III (voiced by Kwesi Boakye in seasons 1–3, Terrell Ransom Jr. in seasons 3–5, Donielle T. Hansley Jr. in seasons 5–6, and Christian J. Simon in season 6 onward) is a 10-year-old orange goldfish who is Gumball's best friend adopted by the Watterson family. Initially given to Gumball as a pet, Darwin later sprouted legs and subsequently became a full member of the Watterson family. The series' first season depicted Darwin with a tendency to be more naive and gullible than others, due to his sudden introduction into the world; subsequent seasons established his more serious side, including the ability to think logically and, in "The Words", speak his mind freely.Although Gumball can sometimes be a negative influence on him, Darwin is extremely loyal to Gumball and often helps him out of sticky situations. He is sometimes shown to not exhibit normal behaviour, such as calling his adoptive parents Mr. Dad and Mrs. Mom.</p>

        <p id="font">I have other hobbies too, but I think Astronomy is my favorite. It always makes me feel like there is a 0.0000000001% chance that we are alone and there is no life out there just because there is so much more to explore. We as humans, always want to journey into the unknown.<cite>"We are finite creatures. Our lives are small and can only scientifically consider a small part of reality. What's common for us is just a tiny part of what's available. We can only see so much of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can only delve so deep into extensions of space. Common sense applies to that which we can access. But common sense is just that. COMMON"</cite> -Miachel Stevens</p>
